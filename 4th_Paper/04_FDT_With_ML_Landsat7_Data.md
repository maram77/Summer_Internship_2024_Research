# Forestry digital twin with machine learning in Landsat 7 data
## Developing a Computer Vision Model for Forest Analysis

The research paper ,"Forestry digital twin with machine learning in Landsat 7 data", outlines a promising approach to developing a computer vision model for forest analysis using remote sensing data. Here's how we can leverage the insights from this paper:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- The paper describes a method to preprocess the large-scale Landsat 7 remote sensing images by slicing them into smaller chunks. This allows the machine learning model to handle the high-resolution data more effectively.
- We can adapt this chunking algorithm to your own forest imagery data, ensuring that the model can process the entire area of interest.
- Additionally, the paper mentions applying normalization techniques to the image data, which can help improve the model's robustness.

### 2. Model Architecture
- The paper proposes an LSTM-based model for predicting future forest images from historical data. This architecture can be adapted to the  task of detecting and identifying trees, as well as estimating their biomass.
- The model consists of three main components:
  1. **Feature Extraction Network**: A convolutional neural network that downscales the input images to extract relevant features.
  2. **LSTM Network**: A long short-term memory (LSTM) network that captures the temporal dependencies in the image sequence.
  3. **Generator Network**: A generative network that produces the predicted forest images based on the features extracted by the LSTM.
- We can use this model as a starting point and modify it to suit your specific requirements, such as adding tree detection and identification capabilities, as well as biomass estimation.

### 3. Training and Evaluation
- The paper provides an algorithm for training the model, which involves jointly optimizing the feature extraction, LSTM, and generator components.
- We can adapt this training procedure to your own dataset and task, ensuring that the model learns to accurately detect and identify trees, as well as estimate their biomass.
- For evaluation, the paper uses the Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) metric to assess the similarity between the predicted and actual forest images. We can consider using this or other relevant metrics to evaluate the performance of our model.

### 4. Handling Challenges
- The paper discusses some challenges, such as dealing with cloud cover and changes in the forest that are not reflected in the historical data.
- We may need to explore additional data sources or techniques to address these challenges, such as incorporating meteorological data or using change detection algorithms.

By leveraging the insights and methodologies presented in the research paper, we can develop a robust computer vision model that can detect and identify trees, as well as estimate their biomass, using remote sensing imagery. Remember to adapt the techniques to your specific dataset and requirements, and be prepared to address any additional challenges that may arise during the development process.
Predicting future forest conditions is not useless, but rather essential for effective forest management and planning. By forecasting forest growth, biomass, and other key metrics, forest managers can make informed decisions about harvesting, conservation, and strategies to mitigate climate change impacts. Accurate predictions enable proactive measures to ensure the long-term sustainability and health of forest ecosystems
