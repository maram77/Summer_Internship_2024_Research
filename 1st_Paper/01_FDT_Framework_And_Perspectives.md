### Nested Approach

- Combines individual tree models to create a comprehensive forest model.
- Integrates various physical and physiological processes across different spatial and temporal scales.

## Technological Components

### Real-Virtual Digital Sockets

- **IoT Devices:** Sap flow sensors, soil moisture sensors, etc.
- **Image Sensing Technologies:** LiDAR, drones.
- **Flux Towers:** Measure gas exchanges.
- **Field Measurements:** Collect various environmental and biological data.

### Virtual Environment

- Hosts digital twins of trees and forests.
- Utilizes continuous data streams for ecological modeling (e.g., species distribution, vegetation dynamics).

## Operational Technologies

- **Cloud Computing:** Enables scalable data storage, analysis, and computational capabilities across distributed forest management applications.
- **Blockchain and Smart Contracts:** Ensure transparency and reliability in data management and ecosystem service transactions, supporting decentralized data access and asset traceability.

## Applications and Benefits

### Management Insights

- Provides real-time insights into ecosystem processes and responses to management interventions.
- Facilitates improved prediction of forest responses to environmental stressors (e.g., drought) and optimized management of ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, timber traceability).

### Future Directions

- Emphasis on reducing the carbon footprint of blockchain technologies and leveraging edge computing for localized AI applications in forest management.
- Potential for enhancing decision-making processes across multiple scales and stakeholders, from regional planning to individual forest stand management.

## Twinning the Tree: The Physical and Biotic State, the Sockets, and the Processes

To create a digital twin of individual trees within the Forest Digital Twin, the framework proposes measuring and recording 15 sets of variables across three main categories:

### Tree-related Variables

- Infrared (IR) leaves temperature
- Lights spectral components
- Radial growth
- Roots growth and dynamics
- Sap flow
- Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emissions
- Tree mechanical stability

### Soil-related Variables

- Soil microbiology
- Soil moisture
- Soil nutrients
- Soil respiration

### Climate-related Variables

- Air temperature
- Air quality parameters
- Humidity
- Wind speed

These variables are crucial for process-based modeling in near-real-time, facilitating the understanding of seven key physical and physiological processes:

- BVOC emission
- Tree biomass production
- Tree phenology
- Tree photosynthesis
- Soil respiration
- Tree stability
- Tree transpiration

## Twinning the Forest: The Physical and Biotic State, the Sockets, and the Processes

Creating a digital twin of the entire forest involves measuring and recording state variables across nine main clusters:

1. Air Quality and Pollution
2. Atmospheric Gaseous and Energy Exchanges
3. Disturbance Regime
4. Forest Management
5. Hydrological Basin Parameters
6. Species Diversity
7. Stand Structure
8. Weather
9. Wildlife and Herbivores

## Risk Management and Early-Warnings

Risk management and early-warning mechanisms are essential for supporting forest risk mitigation actions and providing distinctive information to key forest stakeholders.

## Ecosystem Services Evaluation: The Value of Tree Monitoring

The FDT should provide the evaluation of forest ecosystem services based on the state variables collected at both tree and forest levels, bridging the gap between static field measurements and autonomous data acquisition.

## End-to-End Theoretical Application of a Forest Digital Twin

### Phase 1: Before the Trade

- Verifying data connections.
- Defining the physical and physiological processes and ecosystem services to be monitored.
- Outlining main risks and setting early-warning measures.
- Recording these steps in the digital ledger and notifying the forest manager via the first smart contract.

### Phase 2: Trade and Settlement

- Recording state variables of the trees, surrounding environment, and forest.
- Estimating ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration) and risks (e.g., wildfires).
- Certifying performance for the specific ecosystem service, converting it into credits via the third smart contract.
- Tokenizing the carbon credits, assigning ownership to the forest manager, and enabling the trading process.

### Phase 3: Post-Settlement and Retirement

- Ongoing data collection for risk management and ecosystem service evaluation.
- Settling transactions with buyers, ensuring the credits are retired by the standard setter.
- Enhancing transparency and unlocking further value in forest assets, supporting innovations like buildings as global carbon sinks.

## Discussion and Conclusions

The literature on digital twins in a forest systems context appears novel. The potential of using a forest digital twin to integrate different types of data sources to create a multi-purpose digital replica of the forest has not been fully realized nor explored in-depth prior. 

The fundamental hypothesis behind the FDT is that it represents a novel data-driven systems approach, integrating emerging sensor applications and IoT connectivity. This enables the integration of ecophysiological processes at the tree level with detailed forest structure datasets, extending forest monitoring capabilities in both spatial and temporal domains.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Twinning the Tree and Surrounding Environment:** Ensures high data granularity by continuously monitoring physical and physiological processes of trees.
2. **Data Integration at Stand and Forest Levels:** Unlocks cross-validation and enhances the results of forest-level models.
3. **Risk Assessment and Early Warnings:** Provides early warnings on major threats to the forest, addressing climate change impacts.
4. **Ecosystem Services Monitoring:** Supports the estimation of ecosystem services at the forest level using tree-level data.
5. **Blockchain for Data Storage and Transactions:** Ensures data integrity and facilitates economic transactions on ecosystem services.
