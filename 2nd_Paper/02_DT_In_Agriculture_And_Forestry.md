# Digital Twins in Agriculture and Forestry: A Review

## Overview

This study "Digital Twins in Agriculture and Forestry: A Review" reviews the applications of Digital Twin (DT) technology in open-field agriculture, livestock farming, and forestry, highlighting the transformative potential of DTs.
It identifies and evaluates shared challenges, solutions, and future perspectives that have been overlooked in more narrowly focused reviews.

## Brief Overview of the Digital Twin Concept and Main Related Technologies

DT technology, represents a digital replica of physical entities, facilitating real-time data exchange and advanced simulations. DTs integrate physical and digital spaces through components such as IoT, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and extended reality. These technologies enable comprehensive data acquisition, modeling, and application, supporting diverse sectors like agriculture, forestry, healthcare, and manufacturing. Despite the promising growth and transformative potential of DTs, significant challenges persist, including high implementation costs, data management issues, interoperability with legacy systems, workforce skill requirements, and ethical concerns.

## Methods

### Systematic Review Steps

This study followed a six-step systematic review process: formulating research questions, establishing a research protocol, conducting a literature search, extracting data, analyzing results, and interpreting findings. The research questions addressed DT conceptualization, applications, integration levels, and future challenges. 

### Literature Search

The literature search used keywords related to Digital Twins in agriculture, livestock, and forestry across databases like Scopus and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed, English-language papers. A consensus meeting among co-authors finalized the selection of 34 relevant studies.

### Level of Digital Twin Integration

The study assessed DT integration using the classification by Kritzinger et al., which differentiates between Digital Models (DM), Digital Shadows (DS), and Digital Twins (DT) based on data integration levels.
- **A DM** involves manual data integration.
- **A DS** includes one-way automated data flow.
- **A DT** features bidirectional data exchange, allowing real-time interaction between physical and digital entities.
This classification was applied to understand the integration of DT in open-field agriculture, livestock, and forestry.

### Maturity Level Assessment

The study evaluated DT maturity using the European Union’s **Technology Readiness Level (TRL)** scale, categorizing DTs into Concept (initial phase), Prototype (functional prototype), and Deployed (operational settings). This structured approach informed the exploration of DT integration and its challenges, providing insights into the current state and future perspectives of DT technology.

## Results

This file reviews 34 papers on DT applications in agriculture and forestry. The studies highlight:

- **Application Focus:** Majority in open-field agriculture (21 papers), with fewer in forestry (9) and livestock (4).
- **Integration Levels:** Most DTs are at developmental stages (DSs and DMs), with a few achieving full integration (DTs).
- **Technological Capabilities:** ML algorithms are integral, facilitating real-time data analysis and predictive analytics.
- **Key Outputs:** Optimization of resource management, growth monitoring, and environmental predictions.
- **Data Acquisition:** Relies on IoT sensors, remote sensing, and knowledge databases for monitoring environmental conditions and optimizing agricultural practices.
These findings underscore the growing interest and challenges in implementing DTs in agriculture and forestry sectors.

## Discussion

### How Are DTs Conceptualized and Defined in Agricultural and Forestry Systems?

In this review, a detailed description of DTs and categorization of different levels of implementation in agriculture and forestry were discussed. The review resulted in 34 papers describing DT applications in agriculture and forestry, most of which were at conceptual and prototyping levels. Based on the literature analysis, these studies included all levels of implementation: DM, DS, and DT. This depicts the researchers’ conceptualization of DT in agriculture and forestry. Given the current state of the art and the complexity of these systems, DMs and DSs were considered as DTs in many cases, even though fully deployed DTs ideally require two-way data exchange between the physical and digital twins.
To address the specific attributes of complex biotic and abiotic systems in agriculture and forestry, a new definition is proposed:
"Digital twin in the unpredictable environments of agriculture and forestry can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical system, dynamic or static, and its associated environment and processes, both biotic and abiotic, that at full implementation may be updated through the exchange of information between the physical and virtual systems."

### What Are the Current Applications of DTs in Open-Field Agriculture, Livestock, and Forestry?

The review indicates a growing interest and applications of DTs in agriculture and forestry, particularly in open-field agriculture, forestry, and livestock farming. DTs play a crucial role in crop monitoring, livestock management, and sustainable forestry practices, offering real-time insights and simulation capabilities to optimize practices and enhance productivity.

### To What Extent has DT Integration Been Achieved?

The integration of DTs in the reviewed sectors shows progress but remains predominantly at the prototype and development stages. Most studies in open-field agriculture and livestock are at the DS level, indicating ongoing technological advancement and application maturity. Forestry-related applications also demonstrate progress but are mostly at the DM and DS levels, reflecting the complexity of integrating DTs in forestry systems.

### What Are the Open Questions, Challenges, and Future Perspectives?

Despite advancements, challenges such as accurately replicating dynamic behaviors in agricultural and forestry ecosystems, managing diverse and large datasets, addressing data privacy concerns, and integrating emerging technologies remain. Future perspectives include exploring cloud computing, AI advancements, and user-friendly ICT solutions to enhance DT capabilities and adoption in these sectors.

## Conclusion

In summary, while DTs hold promise for revolutionizing agricultural and forestry practices, their full potential is yet to be realized. Continued research, technological innovation, and collaborative efforts across disciplines are essential to overcome current challenges and maximize the benefits of DTs in these vital sectors.
